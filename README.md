# Parameter-efficient multi-task adaptors for echocardiographic image analysis

Foundation models are currently leading to a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence (AI) from models that have been trained on broad data and can be adapted to many downstream tasks. This work applies the paradigm of pretraining with a pre-text task and building problem-specific adapters for various downstream tasks based on echocardiography input images with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). The interpretation of echocardiography images remains challenging and relies on expert knowledge, highlighting an opportunity for AI to extract quantitative information for clinical decision-making. LoRA enables fine-tuning of task-specific parameters while retaining the full capacity of the pretrained model. For this purpose, Segformer, a transformer-based architecture, is pretrained on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset and serves as the backbone for our adapter. Segformer shows an accurate segmentation of the left ventricle with a dice of 0.926. The adapter with LoRA outperforms a fully trained convolutional neural network (CNN) in cardiac ultrasound view classification with an accuracy of 0.988 and ventricular volume regression with an MAE of 19.622 in the CAMUS dataset. In left ventricle segmentation, the adapter exceeds the performance of a fully trained Segformer MiT-B0 and MiT-B2 architecture with a dice of 0.897. For age determination, the associated adapter could not outperform a fully trained CNN with an MAE of 14.627.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The things you need before installing the software.

* conda

### Installation

A step by step guide that will tell you how to get the development environment up and running.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/adithuer/parameter-efficient-multi-task-adaptors-for-echocardiographic-image-analysis.git
$ cd parameter-efficient-multi-task-adaptors-for-echocardiographic-image-analysis
$ pip install .
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In addition, create a Weights and Biases project, set the project name to the [configuration file](./conf/wandb/wandb.yaml) and create an environment variable WANDB_KEY for the Weights and Biases key.
Finally, change the path in the dataset [configuration file](./conf/dataset/).

## Training

To pretrain the segformer model or [train](train.py) an adapter run the train.py script with the corresponding configuration file. You can use the existing [configuration files](./conf/) as a template.

```
$ python train.py --config-name CONFIG_NAME
```
